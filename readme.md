This tar archive obtains 2 server installation scripts.

"install-ldap-server.sh" - installs and configures LDAP
"install-nfs-server.sh" - installs and configures NFS


To run these scripts you must use the command. "./"

An example is "./install-ldap-server.sh"

Even though our scripts take no parameters, we added a "-h" and "--help" parameter and this tells you exactly what each script does.

An example is "./install-ldap-server.sh -h"
OR "./install-ldap-server.sh --help"
